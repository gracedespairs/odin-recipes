        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the cocoa powder, espresso and vanilla in a bowl and set aside to really infuse the flavors together.</li>
            <li>In a mixer or using a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the salt, mascarpone cheese and continue to whip until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the chilled cream and continue to whip, until light, creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Make sure it can hold a soft peak.</li>
            <li>Dunk each ladyfinger in the espresso mixture to absorb the liquid and start to line a 7x11 oval baking dish with the cookies.</li>
            <li>Top the first layer of cookies with Â½ of the whipped mascarpone mixture and use the back of a metal spoon to spread it into an even layer. Dust with cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Repeat for another layer and then finish by dusting with cocoa powder on top.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
